Error:
- The event tickets the user just put in the shopping cart sold out ⚠️ 
- And the error message makes it worse with all its UX problems. 
- For one thing, it can't even be dismissed! Maybe that's where you can get started this week. 
- Next, you could focus on the style of the notification 
- maybe you could star with using color, or a different font-weight, to help draw attention to the notification.
